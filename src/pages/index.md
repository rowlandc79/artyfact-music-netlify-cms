  Have always loved music. Have tried guitar and singing growing up, but never really got as good as I would have hoped.  Trying my hand at music production now, and with the help of Ableton and the host of amazing synths, soft synths, and tech available these days it's starting to mould into an incredible journey! Things like the Pocket Operator PO35, which I have used on various tracks, the amazing Arturia Microbrute, Korg's Volcas and the Arturia BeatStep Pro and Keystep. Also just love experimenting with the joys of filters & plugins and exploring the realms of possibilities with regards to stereo and spacing within tracks. Am enjoying this journey greatly and hope to tell stories with some the tracks that I write. Hope you can join me on this discovery mission and enjoy some of what comes out the other end! Rock on!
