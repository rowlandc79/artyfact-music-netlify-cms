To stop ourselves from getting bored, and obviously because no other label will pick us up, we've decided now is the time to focus on building our
very own record label. For aspiring artists looking to get their feet off the ground and get that initial push needed to get into this crazy music business.

Let's face it, you have to be a bit nuts to even contemplate this kinda thing in this day and age. So we thought "why not, let's just give it a go and see what happens!"
